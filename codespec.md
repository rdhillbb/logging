# Log Server Specification

## Overview
The Log Server is responsible for creating, managing, and writing log entries to a file within the local `./logs` directory. It provides functions to enable and disable logging, and to write log messages that are processed asynchronously by a dedicated goroutine.

## Requirements

### Directory and File Naming
- Directory Creation:  
  On enabling logging, the server must ensure the `./logs` directory exists. If it does not, the directory should be created.

- File Naming Convention:  
  The log file name must be formatted as:  
  anthropic-debug-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.log  
  where:  
  - YYYY is the 4-digit year  
  - MM is the 2-digit month  
  - DD is the 2-digit day  
  - HH is the 2-digit hour (24-hour format)  
  - MM is the 2-digit minute  
  - SS is the 2-digit second

For example:  
anthropic-debug-20241209-200245.log

### Logging Interface
- EnableLogging() error:  
  - Creates the `./logs` directory if it does not exist.  
  - Opens a new log file with the specified naming format.  
  - Sets the internal state to "enabled" and spawns a goroutine to process incoming log messages.  
  - If logging is already enabled, this function should return immediately without error.  
  - Returns an error if directory or file creation fails.

- DisableLogging():  
  - Sets the internal state to "disabled".  
  - Closes the log message channel (logChan) to signal the goroutine to complete its work.  
  - Waits until the goroutine finishes processing all buffered messages.  
  - Closes the open log file.  
  - If logging is not currently enabled, this function should return immediately without side effects.

- WriteLogs(text string):  
  - If logging is enabled, sends the text message to the logChan channel for asynchronous processing by the goroutine.  
  - If logging is disabled, returns immediately without writing.

### Concurrency and Synchronization
- Channel-Based Logging:  
  All log messages are written to a buffered channel (logChan). A single goroutine (processLogs()) reads from this channel and performs all file write operations, ensuring serialized access to the file.

- Mutex Protection:  
  A sync.Mutex guards critical sections that manipulate the loggerâ€™s internal state and perform file operations. The mutex ensures that enabling, disabling, and file I/O are all thread-safe.

### Goroutine Lifecycle
- The goroutine spawned by EnableLogging() reads from logChan in a loop.  
- Each message read from logChan is written to the file while holding the mutex.  
- When DisableLogging() is called, logChan is closed. The goroutine terminates once all remaining messages are processed.  
- Upon termination, the goroutine signals completion via the done channel, allowing DisableLogging() to safely close the file.

### Error Handling
- If enabling logging fails due to directory or file creation errors, EnableLogging() must return an error. The caller is responsible for handling this error.  
- Once enabled, log writes are asynchronous and should not fail silently. However, if a write error occurs, the code should handle it gracefully within the processing goroutine.

### Performance and Scalability
- The logChan channel is buffered to handle bursts of log messages. If it becomes full, callers of WriteLogs() may block until there is space available.  
- The mutex ensures no concurrent writes to the file, preventing corruption and ensuring that log messages remain ordered as produced.

### Summary
The Log Server must:  
- Create and write to timestamped log files in `./logs`.  
- Support enabling and disabling logging without losing messages.  
- Use a dedicated goroutine and a buffered channel to process log messages asynchronously.  
- Employ a mutex to ensure thread-safe access to shared resources.  
- Gracefully handle start-up, shutdown, and potential I/O errors.
